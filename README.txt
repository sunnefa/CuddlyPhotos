CuddlyPhotos is a photoalbum web application intended to share photos of children.
The photos can only be viewed by people who have the right passwords, each album can be password protected or
the whole gallery can be password protected. The admin users can also create pages with information, such as one page
for each child etc.

Technically this app could be used for any kind of gallery, I just wanted it to have a cute name :-)
